    "output": "New Delhi, the capital of India, was officially inaugurated as the capital in 1931, replacing Calcutta (now Kolkata). Located in northern India within the larger Delhi metropolitan area, it was designed by British architects Sir Edwin Lutyens and Sir Herbert Baker, giving rise to the term Lutyens' Delhi. The city serves as the seat of all three branches of India's government: the Rashtrapati Bhavan (Presidential Palace), Parliament House, and the Supreme Court. New Delhi reflects India's complex history, featuring Mughal-era monuments like the Red Fort and Humayun's Tomb alongside colonial-era buildings and modern infrastructure. As part of the National Capital Territory of Delhi, the entire region encompasses over 32 million people, making it the world's second-largest urban area. New Delhi hosts numerous international embassies and is the political heart of the world's largest democracy."

    "input": "Why do we dream",
    "output": "Dreams are experiences that occur during sleep, especially during the rapid eye movement (REM) stage. Scientists are not completely sure why we dream, but several theories exist. One theory suggests dreams help process emotions and experiences from daily life. Another proposes that dreaming plays a role in memory consolidation, helping the brain organize and store information. Dreams may also allow the brain to simulate situations, solve problems, or explore creative ideas. During dreams, the brain is highly active even though the body is mostly paralyzed to prevent physical movement. Although dreams can be strange or illogical, they are a normal and important part of healthy sleep."

    "input": "what is a comet",
    "output": "A comet is a small celestial object made of ice, dust, and rock that orbits the sun. Comets usually originate from distant regions of the solar system. When a comet approaches the sun, heat causes its ice to vaporize, forming a glowing coma and a tail that points away from the sun. Comets provide valuable information about the early solar system because they contain ancient material. Some comets have predictable orbits and return regularly, while others pass through once. Observing comets helps scientists study the origins of planets and organic molecules."

    "output": "Friction is the force that resists motion when two surfaces come into contact and move against each other. It occurs because surfaces, even those that appear smooth, have tiny imperfections that catch against one another. Friction can be useful, such as allowing us to walk without slipping, grip objects, or stop vehicles using brakes. However, friction can also be undesirable because it causes energy loss in the form of heat and leads to wear and tear on materials. There are different types of friction, including static friction, kinetic friction, rolling friction, and fluid friction. Engineers often design systems to either increase friction, like tire treads, or reduce it, such as using lubrication in machines. Friction is a key concept in physics and everyday life."

    "output": "Waves are disturbances that transfer energy from one place to another without transporting matter overall. They can occur in many forms, including mechanical waves such as sound and water waves, and electromagnetic waves such as light and radio waves. Mechanical waves require a medium, like air or water, to travel through, while electromagnetic waves can move through a vacuum. Waves are characterized by properties such as wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and speed. These properties determine how waves behave and interact with their environment. Waves play a crucial role in communication, technology, and nature, enabling everything from radio broadcasts to seismic activity during earthquakes. Understanding waves helps explain how energy moves across space and through different materials."

It runs in web browsers without requiring compilation, executing client-side to manipulate HTML and CSS, respond to user events like clicks and keystrokes, validate forms, create animations, and fetch data from servers. Modern JavaScript (ES6+) includes features like arrow functions, promises for asynchronous programming, classes, modules, and destructuring. Beyond browsers, Node.js enables JavaScript to run on servers, making it possible to use one language for full-stack development. Popular frameworks and libraries include React for building user interfaces with reusable components, Angular for enterprise applications, Vue.js for progressive web apps, and Express.js for backend APIs. JavaScript powers interactive maps, real-time chat applications, online games, single-page applications that feel like desktop software, and mobile apps through React Native. It's asynchronous and event-driven, using callbacks, promises, and async/await to handle operations without blocking. JavaScript is essential for modern web development!"

    "output": "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside web browsers, enabling developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming. Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, Node.js revolutionized web development by allowing full-stack JavaScript development. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it incredibly efficient for handling concurrent connections, perfect for real-time applications. Unlike traditional server models that create a new thread for each request (expensive and limiting), Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop that handles multiple requests asynchronously, making it lightweight and scalable. NPM (Node Package Manager) is the world's largest software registry with over a million packages for every conceivable functionality, from Express.js for building web servers to Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication. Node.js excels at building RESTful APIs, microservices architectures, real-time applications like chat and collaboration tools, streaming applications, command-line tools, and server-side rendering for React applications. Companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber, and PayPal use Node.js for its performance and scalability. The non-blocking nature means while waiting for database queries or file operations, Node.js can handle other requests, maximizing throughput. However, CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop, so Node.js is better for I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound applications!"

    "output": "Oxidation is a chemical process in which a substance loses electrons during a reaction. It often involves oxygen, but oxidation can occur without oxygen being present. A common example is rusting, where iron reacts with oxygen and moisture to form iron oxide. Oxidation is always paired with reduction, where another substance gains the electrons that were lost. Together, these processes are called redox reactions. Oxidation plays a major role in energy production, corrosion, combustion, and biological processes like cellular respiration. While oxidation can be harmful, such as rust damaging metal, it is also essential for life and technology. Understanding oxidation helps scientists control chemical reactions and prevent material degradation."

    "output": "Volcanoes form when molten rock called magma rises from deep within Earth to the surface. This usually happens because of intense heat and pressure inside the planet. Volcanoes are commonly found at tectonic plate boundaries, where plates either move apart or collide. When plates move apart, magma can rise through cracks in the crust. When plates collide, one plate may sink beneath another, melting rock and forming magma. Magma collects in underground chambers and, when pressure becomes too great, it erupts through openings called vents. Volcanic eruptions can release lava, ash, gases, and rocks. While eruptions can be destructive, volcanoes also create new land and enrich soil with minerals, supporting agriculture and ecosystems over time."

    "output": "There are 195 universally recognized countries, consisting of 193 United Nations member states plus two non-member observer states: the Holy See (Vatican City) and Palestine. This number reflects the current geopolitical landscape, though it has changed dramatically throughout history. The most recent addition is South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011, making it the world's newest country. The concept of a country involves recognition of sovereignty, defined territory, permanent population, and government capable of entering relations with other states. However, the exact number can be controversial depending on recognition policies. Taiwan, for example, operates as a de facto independent state but is claimed by China and lacks UN membership. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 and is recognized by over 100 countries but not by Serbia or Russia. Western Sahara remains disputed between Morocco and the Polisario Front. These complexities demonstrate that nationhood involves both legal sovereignty and diplomatic recognition, making the exact country count somewhat fluid."

    "output": "Cryptocurrency is digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for security, operates independently of central banks, and exists only in electronic form. Bitcoin, created by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009, was the first decentralized cryptocurrency using blockchain technology to record all transactions across a distributed network. Cryptocurrencies use public-private key cryptography where your private key proves ownership and signs transactions while public keys serve as addresses. Mining validates transactions and creates new coins through solving complex mathematical puzzles, though some cryptocurrencies like Ethereum are transitioning to less energy-intensive proof-of-stake validation. Beyond Bitcoin, there are thousands of altcoins: Ethereum enables smart contracts and decentralized applications, Ripple focuses on cross-border payments, Litecoin offers faster transactions, and stablecoins like USDC maintain fixed values by backing with traditional currencies. Cryptocurrency transactions are pseudonymous, irreversible, and typically faster and cheaper than traditional banking for international transfers. They're stored in digital wallets (hot wallets online or cold wallets offline for security). Uses extend beyond currency to NFTs representing digital ownership, DeFi platforms offering financial services without intermediaries, and tokenization of real-world assets!"

It occurs due to genetic variation and natural selection, where individuals with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. These beneficial traits are passed on to future generations, gradually becoming more common over time. Evolution does not occur in individuals but across entire populations. Over long periods, small changes can accumulate and lead to the formation of new species. Evidence for evolution comes from fossils, similarities in DNA between species, observable changes in organisms, and anatomical similarities. Evolution explains the diversity of life on Earth and shows how all living organisms are connected through common ancestry. It is a fundamental concept in biology that helps scientists understand life’s past, present, and future."

    "output": "pH is a scale used to measure how acidic or basic a substance is. It ranges from 0 to 14, where lower values indicate higher acidity, higher values indicate greater basicity, and a value of 7 is considered neutral. The pH scale is logarithmic, meaning each unit represents a tenfold change in acidity or alkalinity. Acids release hydrogen ions (H+), while bases reduce hydrogen ion concentration or release hydroxide ions (OH−). For example, lemon juice has a low pH because it is acidic, while soap has a high pH because it is basic. pH plays a crucial role in chemistry, biology, and environmental science. Living organisms depend on specific pH levels to survive, and even small changes can disrupt biological processes."

    "output": "Encryption is the process of converting readable information (plaintext) into an unreadable format (ciphertext) using mathematical algorithms and cryptographic keys, ensuring that only authorized parties possessing the correct decryption key can access the original information. This fundamental cybersecurity technique protects data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity across digital communications, storage systems, and applications. Two main encryption types exist: symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (like AES-256, used for encrypting files and drives, fast but requires secure key sharing), while asymmetric encryption uses a public key pair where the public key encrypts data and the private key decrypts it (like RSA, perfect for secure communications without pre-shared secrets but computationally slower). Real-world systems typically combine both—using asymmetric encryption to securely exchange symmetric keys, then symmetric encryption for actual data. Encryption strength depends on algorithm quality and key length—AES with 256-bit keys would take billions of years for brute force attacks with current technology. Hash functions like SHA-256 create one-way digests verifying data hasn't been tampered with, used for password storage (storing hashes rather than actual passwords) and blockchain integrity. Encryption secures HTTPS websites showing the padlock icon in browsers, protecting login credentials and credit card information; end-to-end encrypted messaging in WhatsApp, Signal, and iMessage ensuring only recipients read messages; VPNs creating secure tunnels over public networks; encrypted storage with BitLocker, FileVault, or VeraCrypt protecting hard drives; and wireless networks using WPA2/WPA3. Digital signatures using asymmetric encryption prove authenticity and prevent repudiation. Challenges include key management distributing and storing keys securely, quantum computing threatening current algorithms (leading to post-quantum cryptography research), performance overhead, and balancing security with usability. Laws around encryption spark debates between privacy advocates and law enforcement regarding backdoors!"

It was 'cold' because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as 'proxy wars' in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. The era was defined by a nuclear arms race, the space race, and a massive ideological struggle between capitalism and communism. It shaped the modern world's borders, alliances, and international institutions, and its legacy continues to influence global politics and security today."

Judaism emphasizes ethical monotheism, the coming of the Messiah, and a special covenantal relationship between God and the Jewish people. The religion has experienced multiple historical periods: biblical, Second Temple, rabbinic, medieval, and modern. Major branches include Orthodox (strict adherence to traditional law), Conservative (balance of tradition and adaptation), and Reform (progressive interpretation). Jewish practice centers on the Sabbath (Shabbat), dietary laws (kashrut), life cycle events (bar/bat mitzvah, marriage), and annual festivals like Passover, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur. Despite persecution, including the Holocaust, Jews have maintained their identity through diaspora communities worldwide."

    "output": "Charles Darwin was an English naturalist and biologist who developed the theory of evolution by natural selection, fundamentally transforming our understanding of life on Earth and humanity's place in nature. Born in 1809 in Shrewsbury, England, Darwin studied medicine and theology before joining HMS Beagle as a naturalist on a five-year voyage around the world (1831-1836). His observations of species variation, particularly finches on the Galápagos Islands, led him to question the fixity of species. Darwin spent over 20 years developing his theory, meticulously gathering evidence and conducting experiments at his home, Down House. He published 'On the Origin of Species' in 1859, presenting overwhelming evidence that species evolve over time through natural selection - individuals with advantageous traits survive and reproduce more successfully, passing those traits to offspring. The book sold out on its first day and sparked intense scientific and religious controversy. Darwin later published 'The Descent of Man' in 1871, applying evolutionary theory to humans and proposing common ancestry with apes. His theory faced opposition from religious institutions but became the central organizing principle of biology. Darwin corresponded with scientists worldwide, conducted research on barnacles, orchids, earthworms, and emotions. He died in 1882 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, recognition of his monumental contribution to science despite the controversy his ideas generated."

It advocates for a classless society in which all property is publicly owned, and each person works and is paid according to their abilities and needs. The ultimate goal is the elimination of the state and the 'exploitation' of the working class (proletariat) by the owners of the means of production (bourgeoisie). In theory, this leads to total social equality. In practice, however, 20th-century communist regimes, such as the Soviet Union or Maoist China, often resulted in single-party authoritarian rule and state-controlled economies, frequently failing to achieve the theoretical utopia of total equality while centralizing immense power in the hands of the government."

Tokyo's population density reaches 6,363 people per square kilometer, though this includes sparsely populated areas like the Ogasawara Islands. The city began as a small fishing village named Edo and was renamed Tokyo when it became the imperial capital in 1868. Tokyo faces unique urban challenges including earthquake preparedness, with strict building codes and early warning systems essential in one of the world's most seismically active regions. The city operates one of the world's most extensive and punctual public transportation systems, handling over 40 million daily passenger trips. Despite its immense scale, Tokyo maintains remarkably low crime rates and efficient services. The city hosted the 1964 and 2020 Summer Olympics, enhancing its global profile.

    "input": "Who is abraham lincoln",
    "output": "Abraham Lincoln was the 16th President of the United States who led the nation through its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis - the Civil War - and successfully preserved the Union while abolishing slavery. Born in a log cabin in Kentucky in 1809 into poverty, Lincoln was largely self-educated and worked as a rail-splitter, storekeeper, and surveyor before becoming a lawyer. He served in the Illinois legislature and one term in Congress before his opposition to slavery's expansion propelled him to national prominence. Lincoln won the 1860 presidential election, prompting eleven Southern states to secede and form the Confederacy. On January 1, 1863, after the Union victory at Antietam, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring that 'all persons held as slaves' within the rebellious states 'are, and henceforward shall be free,' changing the legal status of more than 3.5 million enslaved African Americans [web:62][web:64][web:65]. The Proclamation transformed the Civil War from a war to preserve the Union into a war for freedom and paved the way for the 13th Amendment, which formally abolished slavery nationwide [web:65]. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address in 1863, with its opening 'Four score and seven years ago,' redefined the war as a struggle for equality and democracy. He was reelected in 1864 and guided the nation toward reunification. Tragically, Lincoln was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth on April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end. His leadership, eloquence, moral courage, and martyrdom made him one of America's greatest presidents and a global symbol of freedom and democracy."

    "output": "A coup d'état, or simply a coup, is the illegal and overt seizure of a state by the military or other elites within the state apparatus. Unlike a revolution, which is usually a mass movement of the people, a coup is a 'top-down' event carried out by a small, organized group. The goal is to replace the existing leadership with a new regime, often a military junta. Coups are most common in countries with weak democratic institutions and high levels of inequality or corruption. While some coups claim to be 'restoring order' or 'ending corruption,' they almost always result in a period of authoritarian rule and the immediate suppression of civil liberties."

    "output": "George Washington was the first President of the United States (1789-1797), a Founding Father, and the commander-in-chief who led American forces to victory in the Revolutionary War, earning him the title 'Father of His Country.' Born in Virginia in 1732 into a planter family, Washington worked as a surveyor before joining the military during the French and Indian War. As tensions with Britain escalated, Washington was appointed commander of the Continental Army in 1775. Despite facing a better-trained, better-equipped British army, Washington's strategic brilliance, perseverance through harsh winters (like Valley Forge), and iconic crossing of the Delaware River for the surprise attack on Trenton led to American victory. His surrender of military power after the war, when he could have seized dictatorial control, established the crucial precedent of civilian control over the military. Washington presided over the Constitutional Convention in 1787, lending his prestige to the new Constitution. Elected unanimously as the first president, he established many precedents including the Cabinet system, the two-term tradition (followed until FDR), and a neutral foreign policy. Washington's Farewell Address warned against political parties and foreign entanglements, advice that influenced American policy for generations. He owned slaves throughout his life but in his will freed all enslaved people under his direct control upon his wife's death, making him the only major Founding Father to do so. Washington died in 1799 at Mount Vernon. His leadership, integrity, and willingness to relinquish power made him indispensable to America's founding and a model of virtuous leadership."

Firewalls inspect each data packet's source address, destination address, port numbers, and protocol, comparing against configured rules to decide whether to allow or block the traffic. Types include network firewalls (hardware or software) protecting entire networks, typically deployed at network perimeters; host-based firewalls running on individual devices like Windows Firewall protecting that computer; and application firewalls filtering traffic for specific applications. Technology generations evolved from packet-filtering firewalls examining headers at network layer making simple allow/deny decisions based on IP addresses and ports (fast but limited); stateful inspection firewalls tracking connection states to understand context and detect anomalies; application layer firewalls (proxies) understanding protocols like HTTP inspecting actual content; next-generation firewalls (NGFW) combining multiple techniques with deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, and application awareness; and modern cloud firewalls protecting distributed cloud infrastructure. Firewalls use default policies like 'deny all, allow exceptions' (whitelist approach maximizing security) or 'allow all, deny exceptions' (blacklist approach maximizing accessibility). Rules specify conditions: allow employee computers to access web servers on ports 80/443, block all incoming traffic except established connections, prevent internal computers from acting as servers, and restrict access to sensitive systems to specific IP addresses. DMZ (demilitarized zone) configurations place public-facing servers between two firewalls isolating them from internal networks. Modern firewalls offer VPN integration, bandwidth management, content filtering blocking malicious websites, and logging for compliance and forensics. Limitations include inability to protect against insider threats, attacks through allowed channels, or encrypted traffic they can't inspect without SSL/TLS interception. Firewalls are essential but insufficient alone—defense in depth combines firewalls with intrusion detection, antivirus, authentication, and monitoring for comprehensive security!"

    "output": "Meditation in Buddhism is a core practice for developing mindfulness, concentration, insight, and ultimately achieving enlightenment (nirvana). The Buddha himself attained awakening through meditation and taught it as essential for understanding the true nature of reality and ending suffering. Two primary forms exist: Samatha (calm abiding) meditation focuses on concentrating the mind, often by fixing attention on the breath, a visual object, or loving-kindness, leading to tranquil states called jhanas. Vipassana (insight) meditation develops penetrating awareness of the three marks of existence: impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), and non-self (anatta), leading to wisdom that liberates from ignorance and attachment. Buddhist meditation is not about blanking the mind or seeking mystical experiences but training attention to observe thoughts, emotions, and sensations without attachment, recognizing their transient nature. Traditionally practiced in monasteries, meditation has spread globally through secular mindfulness programs that adapt Buddhist techniques for stress reduction, mental health, and wellbeing while剥离 religious context. The practice emphasizes regularity over intensity, with even brief daily sessions cultivating awareness that transforms how practitioners relate to experience."

    "output": "Full stack development encompasses both frontend and backend development, where developers possess skills spanning the entire technology stack from user interfaces and user experience to server logic, databases, and deployment, enabling them to build complete applications independently or contribute to any layer of a project. Full stack developers are generalists with T-shaped skills—broad knowledge across all layers with deep expertise in specific areas. The frontend stack includes HTML/CSS for structure and styling, JavaScript with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular for interactive interfaces, responsive design for multi-device compatibility, state management, API integration, and build tools. The backend stack covers server-side languages (JavaScript/Node.js, Python, Java, Ruby, PHP, Go), frameworks (Express, Django, Spring, Rails), RESTful or GraphQL API design, authentication and authorization, business logic implementation, and third-party integrations. The database layer involves relational databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL with SQL queries, NoSQL databases like MongoDB for flexible schemas, Redis for caching, database design with normalization or denormalization, and migrations managing schema changes. DevOps and deployment skills include version control with Git and GitHub, containerization with Docker, cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure), CI/CD pipelines automating testing and deployment, server management or serverless architectures, monitoring and logging, and security best practices. Full stack developers understand how pieces fit together—how frontends call backend APIs, how backends query databases, how authentication flows from login forms through token validation to protected resources, and how to optimize across layers for performance. This holistic perspective enables better architectural decisions, effective debugging across boundaries, and efficient feature implementation without handoff delays. Modern full stack development often specializes in specific stacks: MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) for all-JavaScript, MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) swapping React for Angular, JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, Markup) for static sites with dynamic capabilities, LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) traditional web hosting, and Ruby on Rails full stack framework. Advantages of full stack developers include versatility contributing anywhere in codebases, startup suitability where small teams wear multiple hats, cost effectiveness reducing headcount needs, better communication understanding both sides of API contracts, and prototyping ability building MVPs independently. Challenges include breadth versus depth tension—mastering both sides is difficult, constantly changing ecosystems requiring continuous learning across multiple domains, cognitive load context-switching between different mindsets, and potential knowledge gaps compared to specialists. Full stack roles vary—some companies expect true generalists fluent in all areas, others want backend-focused with basic frontend competency or vice versa. Career development might start specializing in one area then expanding, or beginning with broad knowledge then deepening specific expertise. The term 'full stack' has expanded beyond traditional web development to include mobile development, DevOps practices, data engineering, and machine learning pipelines. Whether specializing or going full stack depends on interests, learning style, career goals, and market demands—both paths offer rewarding careers!"

    "input": "is graphql",
    "output": "GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, providing a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST by allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request, eliminating over-fetching and under-fetching problems while enabling rapid frontend development without backend changes. GraphQL uses a strongly-typed schema defining available data types, fields, and relationships—essentially a contract between client and server describing what data can be queried. Schemas use GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) with types like 'type User { id: ID! name: String! email: String! posts: [Post] }' where exclamation marks indicate required fields and square brackets denote arrays. Clients write queries specifying exactly what fields they want: 'query { user(id: '123') { name, email, posts { title } } }' returns only requested fields, drastically reducing bandwidth compared to REST endpoints returning entire objects. Three operation types exist: queries for reading data, mutations for creating/updating/deleting, and subscriptions for real-time updates via WebSockets. GraphQL provides a single endpoint typically /graphql where all requests go, contrasting with REST's multiple endpoints per resource. The server resolves queries by executing resolver functions for each field, fetching data from databases, other APIs, or any source. Introspection allows querying the schema itself, enabling tools like GraphQL Playground and GraphiQL providing interactive documentation and autocomplete. Advantages include eliminating over-fetching by requesting only needed fields, single requests for related data avoiding multiple round trips (getting user and their posts together), strongly typed schema catching errors early and enabling excellent tooling, rapid frontend iteration without backend changes as long as schema supports queries, and API evolution through deprecation rather than versioning. Major companies like GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb use GraphQL extensively. Popular implementations include Apollo Server and Express-GraphQL for Node.js backends, Apollo Client and Relay for JavaScript frontends managing queries and caching, and GraphQL Yoga for simple setup. Best practices include designing schema around business domain not database structure, paginating large lists with cursor-based pagination, implementing DataLoader batching and caching to prevent N+1 database queries, setting query depth limits preventing expensive nested queries, requiring authentication and authorization at resolver level, and providing meaningful error messages. Challenges include caching complexity since single endpoint complicates HTTP caching requiring client-side solutions, learning curve understanding schema design and resolvers, performance considerations monitoring query cost, over-complication for simple APIs where REST suffices, and file uploads requiring multipart specifications. GraphQL shines for complex applications with related data, multiple clients (web, mobile, IoT) needing different data, and rapidly evolving requirements, though REST remains simpler for straightforward CRUD APIs. The ecosystem continues maturing with federation allowing multiple GraphQL services to compose into unified schemas, and tools handling code generation from schemas ensuring type safety!"

    "output": "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside web browsers, enabling developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming. Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, Node.js revolutionized web development by allowing full-stack JavaScript development. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it incredibly efficient for handling concurrent connections, perfect for real-time applications. Unlike traditional server models that create a new thread for each request (expensive and limiting), Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop that handles multiple requests asynchronously, making it lightweight and scalable. NPM (Node Package Manager) is the world's largest software registry with over a million packages for every conceivable functionality, from Express.js for building web servers to Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication. Node.js excels at building RESTful APIs, microservices architectures, real-time applications like chat and collaboration tools, streaming applications, command-line tools, and server-side rendering for React applications. Companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber, and PayPal use Node.js for its performance and scalability. The non-blocking nature means while waiting for database queries or file operations, Node.js can handle other requests, maximizing throughput. However, CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop, so Node.js is better for I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound applications!"

    "output": "Edge computing is a distributed computing paradigm that brings data processing and storage closer to the sources of data generation—whether sensors, mobile devices, or IoT endpoints—rather than relying on centralized cloud data centers potentially thousands of miles away. This architectural approach reduces latency from hundreds of milliseconds to single digits, decreases bandwidth usage by processing data locally and sending only relevant information to the cloud, improves reliability through continued operation even when cloud connectivity fails, and enhances privacy by keeping sensitive data on-premises. Edge devices include smartphones, smart cameras, industrial sensors, autonomous vehicles, and specialized edge servers. The edge-to-cloud continuum includes the device edge (sensors and actuators), edge gateways aggregating and preprocessing data, edge data centers providing more substantial local computing, and centralized cloud for deep analytics and long-term storage. Applications requiring real-time responses benefit tremendously: autonomous vehicles process camera and lidar data instantly for split-second decisions, augmented reality needs low latency for seamless overlay of digital content, industrial automation responds to equipment anomalies immediately, smart cities process traffic data for real-time signal optimization, and gaming platforms reduce lag for better player experiences. Technologies enabling edge computing include containerization (Docker) for portability, Kubernetes for orchestration, edge AI running machine learning models locally, 5G networks providing high-bandwidth low-latency connectivity, and specialized edge hardware like NVIDIA Jetson or Intel Neural Compute Stick. Challenges include managing distributed infrastructure, ensuring security across numerous endpoints, coordinating between edge and cloud, handling limited resources on edge devices, and developing applications that intelligently partition processing between edge and cloud!"

    "input": "what is two-factor authentication",
    "output": "Two-factor authentication (2FA), also called multi-factor authentication (MFA), is a security mechanism requiring users to provide two different types of evidence (factors) to verify their identity before accessing an account or system, dramatically increasing security beyond passwords alone by ensuring that even if one factor is compromised, the account remains protected. Authentication factors fall into three categories: something you know (passwords, PINs, security questions), something you have (phone, hardware token, smart card), and something you are (fingerprint, facial recognition, iris scan). 2FA combines two different categories—most commonly a password plus a time-based code from your phone. Common 2FA methods include SMS codes sent via text message (convenient but vulnerable to SIM swapping and interception), authenticator apps like Google Authenticator, Authy, or Microsoft Authenticator generating time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) that refresh every 30 seconds (more secure than SMS and works offline), push notifications sent to trusted devices requiring approval, hardware security keys like YubiKey or Titan that plug into USB or use NFC (most secure, immune to phishing), biometric authentication using fingerprints or facial recognition, and backup codes provided during setup for recovery if primary methods fail. The authentication flow involves entering your password (first factor), then being prompted for the second factor through your chosen method, which changes each time making stolen codes useless after brief periods. Benefits include protecting against password breaches where leaked passwords can't access accounts alone, preventing phishing attacks where even if credentials are stolen the attacker lacks the second factor, defending against brute force attacks, and meeting compliance requirements for sensitive data. Most major services offer 2FA including Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, banking apps, and password managers. Implementation best practices include enabling 2FA on all supported accounts especially email (which can reset other accounts), using authenticator apps or hardware keys over SMS, storing backup codes securely, and registering multiple devices avoiding lockout. Limitations include inconvenience adding steps to login, potential lockout if devices are lost (backup codes prevent this), and users sometimes bypassing security choosing weaker methods or writing codes down. Adaptive authentication advances 2FA by analyzing context like location, device, and behavior patterns, prompting additional factors only when risk increases!"

The Andes feature many peaks over 6,000 meters, with Aconcagua being the highest outside Asia at 6,961 meters. The range encompasses diverse ecosystems, from tropical glaciers and high-altitude deserts to cloud forests and Patagonian ice fields. The Andes have been home to advanced civilizations for millennia, including the Inca Empire, which built Machu Picchu and an extensive road system connecting the empire. The mountains contain invaluable mineral resources, including copper, silver, tin, and gold, driving economies but creating environmental conflicts. The Andes are also the birthplace of important crops like potatoes, tomatoes, and quinoa, which were domesticated by ancient peoples and spread globally."

    "output": "Judaism is one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, with approximately 15 million adherents, originating over 3,500 years ago with the covenant between God and Abraham, considered the first patriarch. Central to Jewish belief is the Torah, comprising the first five books of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), which contains 613 commandments (mitzvot) governing religious and daily life. Judaism emphasizes ethical monotheism, the coming of the Messiah, and a special covenantal relationship between God and the Jewish people. The religion has experienced multiple historical periods: biblical, Second Temple, rabbinic, medieval, and modern. Major branches include Orthodox (strict adherence to traditional law), Conservative (balance of tradition and adaptation), and Reform (progressive interpretation). Jewish practice centers on the Sabbath (Shabbat), dietary laws (kashrut), life cycle events (bar/bat mitzvah, marriage), and annual festivals like Passover, Rosh Hashanah, and Yom Kippur. Despite persecution, including the Holocaust, Jews have maintained their identity through diaspora communities worldwide."

    "input": "What is the greenhouse effect",
    "output": "The greenhouse effect is a natural process that helps keep Earth warm enough to support life. Certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and water vapor, trap heat from the sun. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and warms Earth’s surface, which then emits heat back toward space. Greenhouse gases absorb some of this heat and re-radiate it, preventing it from escaping completely. This process maintains a stable global temperature. However, human activities like burning fossil fuels have increased greenhouse gas levels, intensifying the greenhouse effect and leading to global warming. Understanding the greenhouse effect is essential for addressing climate change and protecting Earth’s environment."

    "output": "There are five recognized oceans on Earth: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (or Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. This five-ocean model was officially adopted by the International Hydrographic Organization in 2000, recognizing the Southern Ocean as a distinct body surrounding Antarctica. Together, these oceans cover approximately 71% of Earth's surface, totaling about 361 million square kilometers and containing 97% of Earth's water. The oceans are all interconnected, forming one vast global ocean that regulates climate, produces over half the world's oxygen through phytoplankton photosynthesis, and supports the majority of Earth's biodiversity. Ocean currents act as a global conveyor belt, distributing heat around the planet and playing a crucial role in weather patterns. Despite their vastness, oceans face severe threats from pollution, overfishing, and climate change, with ocean temperatures rising, acidification increasing, and massive plastic accumulation in gyres like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch threatening marine ecosystems worldwide."

    "output": "Malware (malicious software) is any program or code intentionally designed to harm, exploit, or otherwise compromise computer systems, networks, and devices for purposes ranging from financial theft and espionage to vandalism and disruption. Types of malware include viruses that attach to legitimate programs and replicate when executed, spreading through file sharing and downloads; worms that self-replicate and spread automatically across networks without human action, famous examples including the Morris Worm and WannaCry; trojans disguised as legitimate software that create backdoors for attackers, like banking trojans stealing credentials; ransomware encrypting files and demanding payment for decryption keys, with high-profile attacks crippling hospitals, pipelines, and cities; spyware secretly monitoring user activity, logging keystrokes, capturing screenshots, and stealing data; adware displaying unwanted advertisements and tracking behavior; rootkits hiding at system level concealing other malware and maintaining persistent access; and botnets turning infected computers into networks of zombies controlled remotely for DDoS attacks or spam distribution. Infection vectors include phishing emails with malicious attachments or links, drive-by downloads from compromised websites, infected software downloads from untrusted sources, removable media like USB drives, unpatched software vulnerabilities, and social engineering manipulating users into executing malware. Malware consequences range from performance degradation and data theft to identity theft, financial losses, system destruction, and being complicit in attacks on others. Protection requires layered defenses: antivirus and anti-malware software detecting known threats through signatures and behavioral analysis, keeping operating systems and software updated with security patches, using firewalls blocking unauthorized network access, practicing safe browsing avoiding suspicious sites and downloads, exercising email caution not opening unexpected attachments, regularly backing up data for ransomware recovery, using standard rather than admin accounts limiting malware privileges, and employing security awareness training. Advanced persistent threats (APT) combine multiple techniques for long-term espionage against high-value targets. Mobile malware increasingly targets smartphones, while IoT malware compromises connected devices. The malware industry is sophisticated with malware-as-a-service offerings, zero-day exploits sold on black markets, and state-sponsored malware for cyber warfare!"

Pretoria serves as the executive capital where the President and Cabinet are based, located in Gauteng province approximately 50 kilometers north of Johannesburg. Cape Town functions as the legislative capital, hosting the Parliament of South Africa in the shadow of Table Mountain on the country's southwestern coast. Bloemfontein, meaning fountain of flowers, acts as the judicial capital, housing the Supreme Court of Appeal in the Free State province. This arrangement originated from political negotiations between the four original provinces, with Cape Town representing the Cape Colony's interests, Pretoria representing Transvaal, and Bloemfontein representing the Orange Free State. Johannesburg, though not a capital, serves as the economic heart. The three-capital system reflects South Africa's federal structure and the importance of power-sharing in its governance, though it increases administrative complexity and costs."

    "output": "Seasons occur because Earth’s axis is tilted about 23.5 degrees relative to its orbit around the sun. As Earth travels around the sun, different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight throughout the year. When the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, it experiences summer, while the Southern Hemisphere experiences winter. When the tilt is away from the sun, the seasons reverse. The amount of daylight and the angle of sunlight affect temperature and weather patterns. Seasons are not caused by Earth being closer or farther from the sun. Seasonal changes influence ecosystems, agriculture, animal behavior, and human activities across the globe."

Born in London in 1889 into poverty, Chaplin performed in music halls as a child before joining a comedy troupe that toured America. He was discovered by film studios and created his immortal character 'The Tramp' - a lovable vagabond with a bowler hat, cane, oversized shoes, and toothbrush mustache who embodied dignity despite poverty. Chaplin's genius was combining physical comedy with emotional depth and social commentary. He directed, wrote, produced, starred in, and composed music for his films - unprecedented creative control. His masterpieces include 'The Kid' (1921), 'The Gold Rush' (1925) with the famous scene of eating a boiled shoe, 'City Lights' (1931), 'Modern Times' (1936) satirizing industrialization, and 'The Great Dictator' (1940) where he mocked Hitler during WWII with a powerful speech about humanity and tolerance. Chaplin co-founded United Artists studio with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D.W. Griffith, giving artists more control over their work. He resisted talking pictures, believing pantomime was universal. Chaplin's personal life was controversial - he married four times, including to much younger women, and faced paternity suits. His leftist political views led to accusations of communism during the McCarthy era. In 1952, while traveling to London, the U.S. revoked his re-entry permit, and he settled in Switzerland. He returned to America in 1972 to receive an honorary Oscar, receiving a 12-minute standing ovation. Chaplin died in 1977, leaving a legacy as cinema's first global superstar whose Tramp character remains one of film's most recognizable and beloved figures."

At its maximum breadth in Brazil near the mouth, the Amazon spans over 11 kilometers during dry season and expands to more than 48 kilometers wide during flood season between the ports of Gurupá and Santarém. The river's mouth is even more impressive, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean—a estuary so vast it contains the island of Marajó, which at 40,100 square kilometers is larger than Denmark. The Amazon's width is enhanced by its braided channels and extensive floodplains that create a complex river system rather than a single channel. During seasonal flooding, the river rises up to 15 meters, inundating vast areas of rainforest and creating a unique ecosystem where fish swim among trees and aquatic mammals like river dolphins and manatees thrive. This immense width made the Amazon largely non-navigable by early European explorers until steamships were developed, and today oceangoing vessels can travel 3,700 kilometers upstream to Iquitos, Peru."

Born in Salzburg in 1756, Mozart was a child prodigy who began composing at age 5 and performed for European royalty throughout his childhood. His father Leopold, also a composer, recognized his genius and toured him across Europe where he amazed audiences by sight-reading, improvising, and composing complex pieces. Mozart's music is characterized by perfect melodic beauty, emotional depth, structural elegance, and technical sophistication that seems effortless despite its complexity. He excelled in every genre: operas like 'The Marriage of Figaro,' 'Don Giovanni,' and 'The Magic Flute' are still performed constantly; his symphonies (especially the final three - Nos. 39, 40, and 41 'Jupiter') are orchestral masterpieces; his piano concertos, chamber music, and Requiem Mass are cornerstones of the classical repertoire. Mozart moved to Vienna in 1781, where he achieved fame but struggled financially despite his success. He married Constanze Weber and had six children, though only two survived infancy. Mozart composed at incredible speed, often completing entire pieces in his head before writing them down. He died mysteriously in 1791 at just 35, possibly from rheumatic fever, leaving his Requiem unfinished (completed by his student Franz Süssmayr). Mozart's influence on later composers including Beethoven, Brahms, and Tchaikovsky was profound, and his music continues to define classical perfection."

    "output": "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is a cloud computing model providing virtualized computing resources over the internet, offering fundamental building blocks like virtual machines, storage, networking, and load balancers on-demand, allowing organizations to rent infrastructure instead of purchasing and maintaining physical hardware. IaaS represents the most flexible cloud service model giving users maximum control over infrastructure while eliminating capital expenses and reducing time to deployment from months to minutes. Leading providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS) with EC2 compute, S3 storage, and VPC networking; Microsoft Azure with Virtual Machines and Azure Storage; Google Cloud Platform with Compute Engine; and specialized providers like DigitalOcean for developers and Oracle Cloud for databases. IaaS components include compute resources (virtual machines with chosen CPU, RAM, and operating systems), storage (block storage like virtual hard drives, object storage for files and backups, and file storage for shared filesystems), networking (virtual networks, IP addresses, load balancers, firewalls, and VPNs), and often additional services like databases, monitoring, and security tools. Users provision resources through web consoles, APIs, or infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform, configure operating systems and install software, deploy applications, and scale resources up or down based on demand. The pay-as-you-go pricing charges for compute time, storage capacity, data transfer, and additional services, typically billed hourly or per-second. Benefits include avoiding capital expenses purchasing servers, rapid scaling provisioning resources in minutes, global reach deploying across multiple regions, reliability with SLAs guaranteeing uptime, disaster recovery through geographic redundancy, and flexibility choosing configurations and operating systems. Use cases include hosting websites and web applications with traffic variability, development and testing environments created and destroyed as needed, big data analytics processing large datasets, backup and storage solutions, and disaster recovery for business continuity. IaaS suits companies wanting infrastructure control without hardware management, startups needing to scale quickly, and enterprises supplementing on-premise infrastructure. Challenges include the learning curve for cloud platforms, security requiring proper configuration, cost management avoiding unexpected bills from misconfigured resources, and the ongoing responsibility for operating systems, applications, and data security. Reserved instances and spot instances offer cost savings for predictable or flexible workloads. Modern IaaS includes managed Kubernetes for container orchestration, serverless compute options, and hybrid cloud solutions connecting on-premise and cloud infrastructure!"

    "output": "Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications through containerization, packaging software and all its dependencies into standardized units called containers that run consistently across different computing environments. Created by Solomon Hykes in 2013, Docker solves the classic 'it works on my machine' problem by ensuring applications run identically on development laptops, testing servers, and production infrastructure. Containers are lightweight because they share the host operating system's kernel rather than requiring full virtual machines with separate OS instances, using fewer resources while starting in seconds instead of minutes. Docker images are read-only templates containing application code, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files, built from Dockerfiles that specify step-by-step instructions. Images are stored in registries like Docker Hub (public) or private registries, versioned with tags for different releases. Running an image creates a container—an isolated, executable instance with its own filesystem, networking, and process space. Docker Compose orchestrates multi-container applications, defining services, networks, and volumes in YAML files for complex applications with databases, caches, and web servers working together. Docker benefits include consistent environments eliminating configuration drift, rapid deployment and scaling, efficient resource utilization, microservices architecture support where each service runs in separate containers, and simplified dependency management. Development teams use Docker to match production environments locally, while DevOps teams deploy containers across cloud platforms like AWS ECS, Azure Container Instances, or Kubernetes clusters!"

Born Kong Qiu (Master Kong) in 551 BCE during China's Spring and Autumn period, Confucius lived during a time of political chaos and social disorder, which motivated his philosophy aimed at restoring harmony. He worked as a government official but spent most of his life as a wandering teacher with a group of disciples. Confucius's teachings emphasized five key virtues: ren (benevolence/humaneness), yi (righteousness), li (proper conduct/ritual), zhi (wisdom), and xin (trustworthiness). He believed that social harmony depends on people properly fulfilling their roles in relationships - the Five Relationships between ruler-subject, father-son, husband-wife, elder-younger brother, and friend-friend [web:57]. Confucius emphasized filial piety (respect for parents and ancestors), education, self-cultivation, and leading by moral example rather than force [web:57]. His philosophy focused on creating harmonious order through moral force and self-cultivation [web:57]. Confucius's ideas were compiled by his disciples in the 'Analects,' a collection of sayings and conversations that became one of East Asia's most important texts. After his death in 479 BCE, his teachings spread throughout China and eventually influenced Korea, Japan, Vietnam, and much of East Asia. During the Enlightenment, European intellectuals like Leibniz praised Confucius for discovering universal natural laws through reason, celebrating his moral philosophy for its independence from religious dogma [web:60]. Confucianism became China's official state ideology for over 2,000 years and continues influencing modern East Asian societies' values regarding education, family, social harmony, and government. Confucius's emphasis on ethical behavior, respect, education, and social responsibility remains relevant today."

    "input": "what is bandwidth",
    "output": "Bandwidth is the maximum rate of data transfer across a network connection or communication channel, measured in bits per second (bps) and its multiples like kilobits per second (Kbps), megabits per second (Mbps), or gigabits per second (Gbps), representing the theoretical capacity rather than actual throughput which varies based on network conditions, congestion, and protocol overhead. Higher bandwidth enables faster downloads, smoother streaming, better video call quality, and support for more simultaneous users or devices. Internet connections advertise bandwidth specifications—100 Mbps internet means theoretically transferring 100 megabits per second, or about 12.5 megabytes per second (8 bits per byte), though actual speeds often fall short due to network congestion, distance from providers, WiFi limitations, and shared bandwidth among neighbors. Bandwidth differs from latency (delay) and throughput (actual transfer rate)—you can have high bandwidth but poor performance due to high latency or packet loss. The 'pipe' analogy helps: bandwidth is the pipe's width determining maximum flow, while latency is the distance water travels, and throughput is actual water delivered considering restrictions. Bandwidth-intensive activities include video streaming (Netflix HD requires 5 Mbps, 4K requires 25 Mbps), video conferencing (Zoom needs 3-4 Mbps for HD video), online gaming (surprisingly low bandwidth but latency-sensitive), file downloads and uploads (cloud backups, software updates), and multiple simultaneous users or devices. Bandwidth allocation in networks uses Quality of Service (QoS) prioritizing critical traffic, traffic shaping controlling flow rates, bandwidth throttling limiting speeds for specific applications or users, and fair queuing ensuring equitable distribution. Asymmetric connections like cable and DSL offer different upload and download speeds (typically 100 Mbps down, 10 Mbps up) since most users download more than upload, while symmetric connections like fiber provide equal speeds (1 Gbps both directions) ideal for content creators and businesses. Bandwidth testing tools like Speedtest.net, Fast.com, and iPerf measure actual throughput helping diagnose issues. Factors affecting bandwidth include connection type (fiber fastest, DSL slowest), network congestion during peak hours, WiFi signal strength and interference, router capabilities and age, number of connected devices sharing bandwidth, server speeds on the other end, and ISP throttling or caps. Bandwidth optimization techniques include compression reducing data size, CDNs distributing content geographically, caching storing frequently-accessed data locally, lazy loading deferring non-critical resources, image optimization using appropriate formats and sizes, and video adaptive streaming adjusting quality based on available bandwidth. Web hosting considers bandwidth limits—shared hosting typically caps monthly transfer, while dedicated servers offer higher allowances or unmetered bandwidth. Bandwidth costs for businesses depend on usage and connection types—residential broadband relatively affordable, business fiber more expensive but with SLAs, and data center bandwidth priced per traffic volume. Bandwidth monitoring tracks usage patterns, identifies bandwidth hogs, detects anomalies suggesting security issues, and helps capacity planning. Mobile bandwidth uses cellular networks (4G LTE, 5G) with variable speeds based on signal strength, tower congestion, and data plans often including caps and throttling. The bandwidth bottleneck concept identifies the slowest point in a connection path limiting overall speed—might be ISP connection, router, WiFi, or server. Understanding bandwidth helps choose appropriate internet plans, troubleshoot slow connections, optimize application performance, and plan infrastructure capacity. As applications become more data-intensive with higher resolution video, cloud computing, and real-time collaboration, bandwidth requirements continue growing, driving fiber deployment and 5G adoption!"

    "input": "who is usain bolt",
    "output": "Usain Bolt is the fastest human being ever recorded and a Jamaican sprinting legend who dominated track and field for a decade. Born in rural Jamaica in 1986, Bolt showed early talent but was initially more interested in cricket. Standing 6'5\" tall, unusually tall for a sprinter, he overcame scoliosis to become the greatest sprinter in history. Bolt holds the world records in both 100 meters (9.58 seconds) and 200 meters (19.19 seconds), both set at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin and unbroken for over 15 years. He's the only sprinter to win Olympic gold in both events at three consecutive Olympics (2008 Beijing, 2012 London, 2016 Rio), earning him eight Olympic gold medals total including relay victories. Bolt won 11 World Championship gold medals and popularized his signature 'Lightning Bolt' victory pose that became iconic worldwide. Known for his charismatic personality, playful antics, and showmanship, Bolt transcended athletics to become a global superstar. He made sprinting exciting and accessible to casual sports fans through his dominance and entertainment value. Before races, he would dance, joke with competitors, and interact with crowds. Despite his laid-back demeanor, Bolt trained intensely and was supremely confident, often celebrating before finishing races. He retired in 2017 after the World Championships in London and attempted a brief professional football career. Bolt's combination of unprecedented speed, longevity at the top, charisma, and clean record in a sport plagued by doping scandals makes him arguably the greatest track athlete ever."

    "input": "what is graphql",
    "output": "GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs developed by Facebook in 2012 and open-sourced in 2015, providing a more efficient, powerful, and flexible alternative to REST by allowing clients to request exactly the data they need in a single request, eliminating over-fetching and under-fetching problems while enabling rapid frontend development without backend changes. GraphQL uses a strongly-typed schema defining available data types, fields, and relationships—essentially a contract between client and server describing what data can be queried. Schemas use GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) with types like 'type User { id: ID! name: String! email: String! posts: [Post] }' where exclamation marks indicate required fields and square brackets denote arrays. Clients write queries specifying exactly what fields they want: 'query { user(id: '123') { name, email, posts { title } } }' returns only requested fields, drastically reducing bandwidth compared to REST endpoints returning entire objects. Three operation types exist: queries for reading data, mutations for creating/updating/deleting, and subscriptions for real-time updates via WebSockets. GraphQL provides a single endpoint typically /graphql where all requests go, contrasting with REST's multiple endpoints per resource. The server resolves queries by executing resolver functions for each field, fetching data from databases, other APIs, or any source. Introspection allows querying the schema itself, enabling tools like GraphQL Playground and GraphiQL providing interactive documentation and autocomplete. Advantages include eliminating over-fetching by requesting only needed fields, single requests for related data avoiding multiple round trips (getting user and their posts together), strongly typed schema catching errors early and enabling excellent tooling, rapid frontend iteration without backend changes as long as schema supports queries, and API evolution through deprecation rather than versioning. Major companies like GitHub, Shopify, and Airbnb use GraphQL extensively. Popular implementations include Apollo Server and Express-GraphQL for Node.js backends, Apollo Client and Relay for JavaScript frontends managing queries and caching, and GraphQL Yoga for simple setup. Best practices include designing schema around business domain not database structure, paginating large lists with cursor-based pagination, implementing DataLoader batching and caching to prevent N+1 database queries, setting query depth limits preventing expensive nested queries, requiring authentication and authorization at resolver level, and providing meaningful error messages. Challenges include caching complexity since single endpoint complicates HTTP caching requiring client-side solutions, learning curve understanding schema design and resolvers, performance considerations monitoring query cost, over-complication for simple APIs where REST suffices, and file uploads requiring multipart specifications. GraphQL shines for complex applications with related data, multiple clients (web, mobile, IoT) needing different data, and rapidly evolving requirements, though REST remains simpler for straightforward CRUD APIs. The ecosystem continues maturing with federation allowing multiple GraphQL services to compose into unified schemas, and tools handling code generation from schemas ensuring type safety!"

    "output": "Frontend development creates the user-facing part of websites and web applications that users directly interact with in their browsers, encompassing everything visible and clickable including layouts, designs, animations, and interactive elements, translating designs into functioning interfaces while ensuring responsive, accessible, and performant experiences. Frontend code runs in users' browsers using three core technologies: HTML provides semantic structure and content, CSS handles visual presentation and layout, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior. Modern frontend development extends far beyond these basics into sophisticated engineering. Frontend responsibilities include implementing designs from mockups or design systems accurately matching visual specifications, creating responsive layouts adapting to different screen sizes and devices, building interactive components like forms, modals, carousels, and dropdowns, managing application state tracking data across components, making API calls fetching data from backends, optimizing performance ensuring fast load times and smooth interactions, ensuring accessibility for users with disabilities following WCAG guidelines, cross-browser compatibility working consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge, and SEO optimization helping search engines discover content. Modern frontend uses JavaScript frameworks and libraries: React dominates with component-based architecture and virtual DOM, Vue.js offers approachability and progressive adoption, Angular provides comprehensive enterprise framework with TypeScript, Svelte compiles components to efficient vanilla JavaScript, and newer options like SolidJS and Qwik push performance boundaries. Build tools and bundlers transform modern code for browsers: Webpack bundles modules and assets, Vite offers lightning-fast development with instant updates, Babel transpiles modern JavaScript to compatible versions, and TypeScript adds type safety catching errors during development. CSS has evolved with preprocessors like Sass/SCSS adding variables and nesting, CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components colocating styles with components, utility-first frameworks like Tailwind CSS providing composition through classes, and modern CSS features like Grid and Flexbox enabling sophisticated layouts without frameworks. State management libraries handle complex data: Redux provides predictable state containers, MobX uses observables for reactive updates, Zustand offers simplicity, and React Context API shares state without props drilling. Frontend testing includes unit tests for individual functions, component tests ensuring UI elements work correctly, integration tests verifying multiple parts working together, and end-to-end tests simulating real user flows with tools like Cypress or Playwright. Performance optimization techniques include code splitting loading only needed code, lazy loading deferring non-critical resources, image optimization with modern formats and responsive images, caching strategies with service workers, and minimizing JavaScript bundles. Frontend developers collaborate closely with designers ensuring fidelity to designs, backend developers integrating APIs, UX researchers incorporating user feedback, and product managers translating requirements into implementations. The field constantly evolves with new tools, frameworks, and best practices—staying current requires continuous learning. Career paths include specializing in performance optimization, accessibility, animation, or expanding into full-stack development. Modern frontend engineering is sophisticated, requiring deep JavaScript knowledge, understanding of rendering performance, security awareness preventing XSS attacks, and systems thinking for scalable applications!"

    "output": "REST (Representational State Transfer) API is an architectural style for designing networked applications using HTTP protocol, treating server resources as entities accessed through standard HTTP methods, providing a stateless, scalable, and straightforward approach to building web services that has become the dominant API design pattern for web applications. REST was defined by Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation establishing principles that leverage HTTP's existing capabilities. RESTful APIs organize functionality around resources identified by URLs—each resource (users, products, orders) has unique endpoints like /api/users/123 representing the user with ID 123. HTTP methods map to operations: GET retrieves resources without side effects (idempotent), POST creates new resources, PUT updates entire resources, PATCH partially updates resources, and DELETE removes resources. Status codes communicate outcomes: 200 OK for success, 201 Created for new resources, 204 No Content for successful deletion, 400 Bad Request for client errors, 401 Unauthorized for authentication failures, 404 Not Found for missing resources, and 500 Internal Server Error for server problems. REST constraints include statelessness where each request contains all necessary information without server-side session storage, enabling scalability through load balancing; client-server separation allowing independent evolution; cacheability with responses marked cacheable or not; layered system where clients can't tell if connected directly to end server; uniform interface providing consistency; and optionally code on demand with server-supplied executable code. RESTful URLs follow conventions: /api/users for collections, /api/users/123 for specific items, /api/users/123/posts for nested resources, query parameters for filtering (?status=active&limit=10), and avoiding verbs in URLs since HTTP methods provide actions. Request and response bodies typically use JSON for its readability and language-agnostic parsing, though XML and other formats work. Authentication mechanisms include API keys in headers, bearer tokens (JWT) containing user information, and OAuth for delegated authorization. REST API design best practices include versioning APIs (/api/v1/users) for backward compatibility, pagination for large collections, filtering and sorting options, consistent error responses with helpful messages, HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State) including links to related resources, comprehensive documentation describing endpoints, parameters, and examples, and rate limiting preventing abuse. Tools like Postman and Insomnia test APIs during development, Swagger/OpenAPI documents APIs with interactive testing, and frameworks like Express, Django REST Framework, and Spring Boot simplify creation. Advantages include simplicity and familiarity leveraging HTTP, statelessness enabling horizontal scaling, flexibility with multiple client types consuming same API, and wide tooling support. Limitations include multiple round trips for related data (N+1 problem), over-fetching or under-fetching data, difficulty representing complex operations beyond CRUD, and lack of real-time capabilities. GraphQL emerged addressing some limitations by letting clients specify exact data needs, though REST remains widely used for its simplicity and well-understood patterns!"

Unlike 'civil liberties' (which are protections from government interference), civil rights often require the government to take active steps to ensure equality. The American Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 60s is the most famous example of a struggle to secure these rights for a marginalized group through protest, legislation, and court battles. They are essential for ensuring that all citizens can participate fully in a democratic society."

Born Cassius Clay in Louisville, Kentucky in 1942, he began boxing at age 12 and won an Olympic gold medal at the 1960 Rome Olympics. Ali won the world heavyweight championship at age 22 by defeating Sonny Liston in 1964, then shocking the world by announcing his conversion to Islam and name change to Muhammad Ali. He was a master boxer with incredible hand speed, footwork (he would 'float like a butterfly'), and the ability to 'sting like a bee' with precise combinations. Ali's charisma, trash-talking, and poetic predictions ('I'll beat him in eight!' rhymed his round predictions) made him a media sensation. In 1967, at his career peak, Ali refused induction into the U.S. Army citing religious beliefs and opposition to the Vietnam War, saying 'I ain't got no quarrel with them Viet Cong.' He was stripped of his titles, banned from boxing for three years, and faced up to five years in prison (later overturned by the Supreme Court). Ali's stand against the war made him a hero to anti-war activists and the Black community while vilified by others. He returned to boxing in 1970 and engaged in legendary fights including the 'Fight of the Century' against Joe Frazier, 'The Rumble in the Jungle' against George Foreman in Zaire (knocking out the heavily favored champion), and the 'Thrilla in Manila' rematch with Frazier. Ali retired in 1981 with a 56-5 record and three heavyweight titles. He was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, possibly from boxing, but remained active in humanitarian causes, lighting the Olympic flame at the 1996 Atlanta Games in a touching moment. Ali died in 2016, leaving a legacy as 'The Greatest' - a champion who stood for his principles regardless of personal cost."

American architects Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin won an international competition to design the city in 1912, creating a planned city centered around Lake Burley Griffin and incorporating geometric patterns aligned with topographical features. Officially named the capital in 1913 and housing the federal parliament from 1927, Canberra covers 814 square kilometers and has a population exceeding 450,000.

He won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 specifically for explaining the photoelectric effect, which laid foundations for quantum theory. Einstein immigrated to the United States in 1933 to escape Nazi persecution, joining Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study where he worked until his death. Beyond physics, he was a passionate advocate for peace, civil rights, education, and Zionism. His work enabled modern technologies like GPS, lasers, nuclear energy, and solar panels. Einstein's wild hair, playful personality, tongue-out photo, and profound quotes like 'Imagination is more important than knowledge' have made him an enduring cultural icon representing genius itself. He passed away in 1955, leaving an unmatched legacy in science and human thought."

    "input": "is node.js",
    "output": "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine that executes JavaScript code outside web browsers, enabling developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming. Created by Ryan Dahl in 2009, Node.js revolutionized web development by allowing full-stack JavaScript development. Its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model makes it incredibly efficient for handling concurrent connections, perfect for real-time applications. Unlike traditional server models that create a new thread for each request (expensive and limiting), Node.js uses a single-threaded event loop that handles multiple requests asynchronously, making it lightweight and scalable. NPM (Node Package Manager) is the world's largest software registry with over a million packages for every conceivable functionality, from Express.js for building web servers to Socket.io for real-time bidirectional communication. Node.js excels at building RESTful APIs, microservices architectures, real-time applications like chat and collaboration tools, streaming applications, command-line tools, and server-side rendering for React applications. Companies like Netflix, LinkedIn, Uber, and PayPal use Node.js for its performance and scalability. The non-blocking nature means while waiting for database queries or file operations, Node.js can handle other requests, maximizing throughput. However, CPU-intensive tasks can block the event loop, so Node.js is better for I/O-bound rather than CPU-bound applications!"

    "output": "Acids and bases are two important categories of chemical substances that behave differently in solution. Acids are substances that donate hydrogen ions (H+) and typically taste sour, such as vinegar or lemon juice. Bases accept hydrogen ions or release hydroxide ions (OH−) and often taste bitter or feel slippery, like soap. Acids and bases react with each other in neutralization reactions, producing water and a salt. The strength of an acid or base depends on how easily it releases or accepts ions. Acids and bases are essential in many biological processes, industrial applications, and everyday products. Maintaining proper acid-base balance is critical for life, especially in blood and cellular environments."

    "input": "what is a chemical reaction",
    "output": "A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more substances, called reactants, are transformed into new substances known as products. During a chemical reaction, atoms are rearranged as chemical bonds break and new bonds form, but the atoms themselves are not destroyed. Examples of chemical reactions include burning fuel, rusting iron, digestion of food, and cooking. Chemical reactions can release energy, such as heat and light, or absorb energy from their surroundings. Factors like temperature, concentration, and catalysts can affect how fast reactions occur. Chemical reactions are fundamental to all natural processes and technologies, including industrial manufacturing, biological metabolism, and environmental changes. Understanding chemical reactions helps scientists control processes safely and efficiently."

    "input": "how do planes fly?",
    "output": "Planes fly by generating lift, a force that counteracts gravity. Lift is created by the shape and angle of airplane wings, known as airfoils. As a plane moves forward, air travels faster over the curved top of the wing than underneath, creating lower pressure above and higher pressure below. This pressure difference produces lift. Engines provide thrust to move the plane forward, while drag resists motion. Weight pulls the plane downward due to gravity. When lift exceeds weight and thrust overcomes drag, the plane can take off and stay airborne. Careful control of these forces allows airplanes to fly safely and efficiently."

    "input": "what is the speed of light?",
    "output": "The speed of light is approximately 300,000 kilometers per second when traveling through a vacuum. It is the fastest speed at which energy or information can travel in the universe. This speed is so fundamental that it affects how space and time behave, as described in Albert Einstein’s theory of relativity. Because light takes time to travel, observing distant stars means seeing them as they were in the past. Nothing with mass can reach or exceed the speed of light, making it a universal speed limit. The speed of light plays a crucial role in modern technologies such as GPS systems, satellite communication, and fiber-optic internet. It is one of the most important constants in physics."

    "input": "is framework",
    "output": "A framework is a pre-built, structured foundation of reusable code, libraries, tools, and conventions that provides a scaffold for building applications, handling common tasks and enforcing architectural patterns so developers can focus on unique business logic rather than reinventing foundational functionality. Frameworks differ from libraries in control flow—frameworks use inversion of control where the framework calls your code (you fill in blanks), while libraries are tools you call from your code (you maintain control). Web frameworks like Django (Python) and Ruby on Rails follow MVC (Model-View-Controller) patterns providing routing, database ORM, authentication, and admin interfaces; Express.js (Node.js) offers minimalist server frameworks; React, Angular, and Vue.js provide frontend frameworks with component architectures; Spring (Java) delivers enterprise application frameworks; and Laravel (PHP) combines elegance with functionality. Mobile frameworks include React Native and Flutter for cross-platform development, SwiftUI for iOS, and Jetpack Compose for Android. Frameworks embody best practices accumulated over years of development, providing solutions to common problems like security vulnerabilities, performance optimization, and cross-browser compatibility. They establish conventions around project structure, naming, and organization reducing decision fatigue and making codebases consistent and understandable to others familiar with the framework. Opinionated frameworks like Rails make many decisions for you following the 'convention over configuration' philosophy offering faster development but less flexibility, while unopinionated frameworks like Express provide minimal structure allowing more freedom but requiring more decisions. Benefits include accelerated development by leveraging pre-built functionality, community support with extensive documentation, tutorials, and packages, maintenance and updates by framework maintainers, security patches for discovered vulnerabilities, and standardization facilitating collaboration. Popular frameworks have large ecosystems—Django has packages for payments, REST APIs, and social authentication; React has component libraries like Material-UI and state management tools. Choosing frameworks involves considering learning curve (simpler vs. powerful), community size (support and resources), performance characteristics, scalability, and alignment with project needs. Trade-offs include framework lock-in making switching difficult, learning curve understanding framework concepts, potential bloat including unused features, update breaking changes requiring migration effort, and performance overhead from abstraction layers. Modern trends include micro-frameworks offering minimal functionality for microservices, full-stack frameworks like Next.js handling frontend and backend, and serverless frameworks like SAM for AWS Lambda deployment!"

    "output": "Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrations that travel through a medium such as air, water, or solid materials. When an object vibrates, it causes nearby particles to move back and forth, creating pressure waves that propagate outward. These waves reach our ears and are interpreted by the brain as sound. Sound waves are characterized by frequency, which determines pitch, and amplitude, which determines loudness. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because it requires a medium to move through. Sound plays an essential role in communication, music, navigation, and many technologies. From spoken language to medical ultrasound imaging, sound waves are a fundamental part of human experience and scientific application."

It serves as a blueprint for how the government is structured, defining the powers of different branches and the relationship between the state and its citizens. Constitutions can be written (like the U.S. Constitution) or unwritten, consisting of a collection of historical documents and traditions (like the UK’s). Beyond just organizing government, a constitution often contains a list of fundamental rights that the government cannot legally violate. Because it is the foundation of the legal system, changing a constitution usually requires a much more difficult process than passing a regular law, such as a supermajority vote or a national referendum, ensuring long-term stability."

    "input": "WHAT IS THERMODYNAMICS",
    "output": "Thermodynamics is the branch of physics that studies heat, energy, and how they relate to work. It explains how energy moves through systems and why certain processes occur naturally. One key principle of thermodynamics is that heat flows from hotter objects to cooler ones, not the other way around. Another important idea is that no energy conversion is perfectly efficient; some energy is always lost as waste heat. Thermodynamics is governed by several laws that describe energy conservation, entropy, and equilibrium. These principles are essential in understanding engines, refrigerators, power plants, chemical reactions, and biological processes. Thermodynamics helps engineers design efficient machines and helps scientists understand how energy shapes the physical world."

    "input": "is cdn",
    "output": "A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and data centers working together to deliver web content—images, videos, JavaScript, CSS, HTML—to users from servers physically closest to their location, dramatically reducing latency, improving load times, and handling massive traffic loads through distributed infrastructure. CDNs solve the distance problem: without CDNs, a user in Australia accessing a website hosted in the US experiences slow page loads as data travels halfway around the world; with CDNs, content is cached on edge servers near the user delivering nearly instant access. When a user requests content, the CDN routes the request to the nearest edge location (point of presence) containing cached copies; if cached, content is served immediately; if not (cache miss), the edge server fetches it from the origin server, caches it locally, and serves it to the user—subsequent requests hit the cache. CDN architecture includes origin servers containing original content, edge servers (hundreds globally) caching and serving content, and CDN software managing routing, caching, and health monitoring. Major CDN providers include Cloudflare with 200+ locations and free tier, AWS CloudFront integrated with AWS services, Fastly offering edge computing, Akamai the largest enterprise CDN, and Cloudinary specializing in image/video optimization. Benefits include faster load times improving user experience and SEO rankings, reduced bandwidth costs since origin servers serve less traffic, handling traffic spikes distributing load across edge servers preventing origin overwhelm, improved availability through redundancy where if one server fails others serve content, and enhanced security with DDoS protection absorbing attacks at edge locations and SSL/TLS encryption. Modern CDNs provide edge computing running code at edge locations (Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda@Edge) enabling dynamic content generation, A/B testing, and authentication without origin server involvement. CDN configuration involves setting up DNS pointing domains to CDN providers, configuring caching rules specifying what to cache and for how long using HTTP headers like Cache-Control and Expires, cache invalidation/purging removing outdated content, and origin shield reducing load by adding a caching layer between edge and origin. Content types cached include static assets (images, videos, CSS, JavaScript) cached indefinitely or long periods, dynamic content cached briefly or personalized at edge, API responses cached with short TTLs, and streaming media using adaptive bitrate streaming. Cache strategies use TTL (time to live) determining cache duration, cache keys identifying unique cached items, cache hierarchy with multiple tiers, and cache warming pre-loading content before traffic spikes. Security features include DDoS protection with traffic scrubbing absorbing attacks, Web Application Firewall (WAF) blocking malicious requests, SSL/TLS certificates encrypting communication, token authentication restricting access, and bot management detecting and blocking scrapers. Monitoring dashboards show cache hit ratios measuring efficiency, bandwidth usage, traffic patterns, and geographic distribution of requests. Use cases include media streaming delivering video globally, e-commerce handling traffic spikes during sales, gaming distributing downloads and updates, SaaS applications improving performance globally, and static websites with tools like Netlify and Vercel providing CDN automatically. Considerations include cost typically based on bandwidth and requests, cache invalidation complexity ensuring users see updated content, dynamic content limitations requiring personalization at edge or origin, and troubleshooting cached errors requiring debugging. CDNs are fundamental infrastructure for modern web applications, expected by users accustomed to instant loading—sites without CDNs feel slow and unresponsive, directly impacting business metrics, user satisfaction, and search rankings!"

    "input": "WHAT IS RADIOACTIVITY",
    "output": "Radioactivity is a natural process in which unstable atomic nuclei release energy by emitting particles or electromagnetic radiation. This occurs because the nucleus has too much energy or an imbalance of protons and neutrons. There are three main types of radioactive radiation: alpha particles, beta particles, and gamma rays. Radioactivity has many important applications, including medical imaging, cancer treatment, energy production in nuclear power plants, and dating ancient objects using radiometric techniques. However, excessive exposure to radiation can damage living cells and cause serious health problems. Scientists carefully control and monitor radioactive materials to ensure safety. Radioactivity plays a significant role in understanding atomic structure and the behavior of matter at a fundamental level."

    "output": "The sky appears blue because of the way sunlight interacts with Earth’s atmosphere. Sunlight contains all colors of visible light, but when it enters the atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules such as nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules scatter shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, more than longer wavelengths like red. Although violet scatters more, human eyes are more sensitive to blue light, and some violet light is absorbed by the atmosphere. As a result, the scattered blue light dominates our vision. During sunrise and sunset, sunlight travels through more atmosphere, scattering blue light away and making the sky appear red or orange."

    "output": "There are 195 universally recognized countries, consisting of 193 United Nations member states plus two non-member observer states: the Holy See (Vatican City) and Palestine. This number reflects the current geopolitical landscape, though it has changed dramatically throughout history. The most recent addition is South Sudan, which gained independence from Sudan in 2011, making it the world's newest country. The concept of a country involves recognition of sovereignty, defined territory, permanent population, and government capable of entering relations with other states. However, the exact number can be controversial depending on recognition policies. Taiwan, for example, operates as a de facto independent state but is claimed by China and lacks UN membership. Kosovo declared independence in 2008 and is recognized by over 100 countries but not by Serbia or Russia. Western Sahara remains disputed between Morocco and the Polisario Front. These complexities demonstrate that nationhood involves both legal sovereignty and diplomatic recognition, making the exact country count somewhat fluid."
